//TODO add chrome extension here
// When I first started at Paradox (formerly Spetz), I was put in charge
// of a small side project that turned out to be a big deal. I designed
// and developed a chrome extension using WhatsApp API that was
// downloaded by thousands of users, written about in Geektime Magazine
// and became a lead generating tool for the company. Not only was this
// the first project I was in charge of, it was my first project EVER
// outside of school. The experience proved to both me and the company
// that I can turn an idea into a product, learn as I code and solve
// problems on the go.
