        <p>
          Iâ€™m a full stack developer with over 3 years of experience. I used to
          work for a successful startup in Tel Aviv that was acquired by
          Paradox, Inc. I quit my beloved job just over a year ago to move to
          the US and try out a different lifestyle. My partner and I are both
          rock climbers and we love the outdoors. We live in a van, in nature
          and on the road, slowly moving around the country and climbing as many
          rocks as we can. Vanlife has been awesome but I miss coding and am now
          looking for the next step in my career.
        </p>

        <p>
          My experience in a small startup made me a fast and independent
          learner. I gained a lot of experience with Vue.js, JavaScript, CSS and
          HTML and feel confident using these tools in complex ways. Since
          leaving my job I have turned my attention to new frameworks. I have
          mainly focused on React and am trying to familiarize myself with other
          tools that will make me a stronger and more well-rounded developer.
          Learning on my own and expanding my skill set has been exciting but I
          am looking forward to working on cool products and being part of a
          team once again.
